vertiginously at first, then declines more slowly—like the profile of a ski jumper leaping into space, to land and coast down the gentler slope below. That is a classic scaling pattern. Zipf, eyeballing his charts and fitting a curve to the data, devised a formula for it. I was spellbound. By the end of that long Metro ride, I had the topic for half of my doctoral thesis: I knew exactly how to expand on the math behind word frequencies in a way Zipf, no mathematician, could not. In subsequent months, what I found was surprising. By playing with the equation, you could build a powerful tool of social measurement. An improvement on Zipf’s formula could quantify the richness of someone’s vocabulary and give it a numerical grade: high grade, rich vocabulary; low grade, poor vocabulary. It could measure differences from text to text, from speaker to speaker. It could capture erudition in a number. Still, friends and advisers were aghast at my determination to pursue this strange avenue. Zipf was a crank, they told me. They showed me his book: dreadful. Counting words was not real math. I would never get a proper job, no easy professorship. But I was seeking no advisers. In fact, I wrote the thesis without one, and persuaded one of the university’s bureaucrats to rubberstamp it when it was completed. I was determined to follow this trail to the end—and reading Zipf led to economics. It was not just diction that could be reduced to a power law. Whether we are rich or poor, thriving or starving, also appeared subject to strong influence.
