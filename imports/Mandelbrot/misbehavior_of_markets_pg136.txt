In 1950, I was a young mathematics student in search of a good topic for my thesis at the University of Paris. My uncle, Szolem, was the local model of a mathematics professor: Very theoretical, deeply conservative, and—despite his having been born in Poland—a pillar of the French academic establishment. He was elected to a full professorship at the prestigious College de France at the precocious age of thirty-nine.
